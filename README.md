    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    
    Ensuring that my program is secure, first requires a visual inspection of all lines of code. This step is to make sure I have not left any obvious errors in the 
    code. Next, unit testing is a great way to determine if the requirements are being met, and that the program behaves the way that I expect. Scanning for 
    security vulnerabilites can also help keep code programs secure. 
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    
    I can interpret user needs and incorportate them into a project by closely following all requirements. User requirements provide all of the necessary elements 
    that must be in the final piece of software to ensure that it is useful for the customer. 
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    
    I approach designing software in a detail oriented manner. Carefully reviewing requirements, making suggestions to improve function, and 
    providing feedback along the way.
